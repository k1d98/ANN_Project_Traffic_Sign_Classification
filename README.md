# ANN_Project_Traffic_Sign_Classification
DATASET
The dataset we will work on is called  German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. 
Itâ€™s multiclass, single image classification where we want to classify images to the 
corresponding traffic sign class. For example some of those classes are stop signs, 
different speed limits and others in a total of 43 classes (labeled with numbers from 0 to 42).

LOADING THE DATA
We have loaded the data with the pickle module. Pickle uses binary protocols for serializing
and de-serializing a Python object structure.These images are already split into 3 sets
(train, test and validate) and they are all in the same shape (32, 32, 3).

PREPROCESSING
Without any preprocessing, our scores for accuracy are very similar while we saw a difference in the loss. 
We have applied: grayscaling, histogram equalization and normalization - in that order.
